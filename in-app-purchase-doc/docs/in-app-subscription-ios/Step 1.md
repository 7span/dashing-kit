- Give reference name of subscription group.

:::danger Keep in mind that...
- Users can only subscribe to one subscription in a group at a time, but can change to another subscription in the same group.
- Since users can only buy one subscription within a group at a time, creating a single group is the best practice for most apps as it prevents users from accidentally purchasing multiple subscriptions. 
- Users who buy subscriptions in multiple groups will be billed separately for each subscription.
